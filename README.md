# Blok
A standalone minecraft server written in Kotlin

The theory behind Blok is that I wanted to have a minecraft server specifically designed for minigames.
Worlds only saving when you tell them to, no Entity AI (by default at least), things like that.
This way, we only do things if you **want** them to happen, nothing will happen without you telling it to.
